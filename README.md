An NOAA dataset is the dataset used for this project. Note: The data comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.

Each row in the datafile corresponds to a single observation.

The following variables are provided :

    id : station identification code

    date : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)

    element : indicator of element type

    TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)

    TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)

    value : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)

For this project:

We return a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day should be shaded.

Then, overlay a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.

Finaly Make the visual nice!

The data used is near Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States.
